The college becomes constituent unit of Magadh University, Bodh Gaya, Bihar on 1st February 1976. Later on, Veer Kunwar Singh University was formed after the bifurcation of Magadh University in October 1992 with headquarters at Ara. The college/university is recognized under the 2(f) and 12(b) of the UGC regulation .It is quite evident that the Maharaja College is much older than the present Veer Kunwar Singh University Ara.
